# Infil Launcher - 1st RRF official launcher
Developed in house by CPT. Rodriguez, INFIL allows for easy modpack updates, game launching, with many improvements coming soon. 

# Setup

### Setup
* Go to Releases and download the Infil.Launcher.zip File
* Extract the file and run setup.exe
* You maybe prompted by Microsoft, that the file is untrusted, make sure to override it and run it anyway. This occurs as the package has not been signed with a signing certificate and therefore renders this error.
* The program should auto install and run, however if it doesn't you can run it from your programs
* Setup the file paths for ARMA3Launcher.exe and your selected mod folder via the Options tab
* Update/Verify your modpack
* Move userconfig in your modpack folder to your ARMA 3 Directory (If you run into issues, talk to someone in teamspeak)
* Merge the Modpack Teamspeak Plugins folder with your Teamspeak plugins folder (If you run into issues, talk to someone in teamspeak)
* Run the Game   

### Updating the Launcher
You can easily update the launcher to the latest version by running the setup.exe file again, this will pull the latest binary from our content server and run it.

  
### Issues
